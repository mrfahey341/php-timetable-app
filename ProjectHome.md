**Update: source now committed for your editing/reuse pleasure!**

First used at www.nextmanlyferry.com, this cobbled together selection of php code reads times of events from text files for each day of the week, and shows to the user the next, previous, and next +1 event according to your current server timezone. It's ideal for displaying a public transport timetable, as well as any event that occurs many times throughout a given day,

It includes in-built handling of public holidays (by specific date), events that roll over into the next day, daylight savings and timezone offsets.

Also included is front-end css, sample website terms and conditions copy and (hopefully) easy setup with no database required - all configuration is stored within one php file and timetable text files.

It's released under the MIT license, which from my reading, allows you to do pretty much anything with this code as long as you credit the original author and link to this page.

It really needs someone to rework much of the duplicate functions into something more simple and lean, as well as various language localisations. Interested in helping out? Please get in touch - keith at newformula dot org.
